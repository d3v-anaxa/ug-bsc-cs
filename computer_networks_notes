Attenuation:
    Definition: Attenuation refers to the decrease in signal strength as it travels over a distance in a transmission medium.
    Cause: It occurs due to factors such as resistance, scattering, and absorption in the transmission medium.
    Effect: Weaker signals may result in a loss of information and reduced signal quality.
            = 10 log_10 (P_2/P_1) [; >0 in case of attenuation]

Distortion:
    Definition: Distortion involves changes in the shape of the signal waveform.
    Cause: It can be caused by factors such as frequency-dependent attenuation, multipath propagation, and non-linearities in the transmission medium.
    Effect: Distorted signals may lead to misinterpretation of the transmitted information.

Noise:
    Definition: Noise is an unwanted random signal that is added to the original signal during transmission.
    Cause: Various sources, including electronic components, thermal effects, and external interference, can introduce noise.
    Effect: Noise can degrade the signal-to-noise ratio, making it harder to distinguish the desired signal from the unwanted background noise.

Delay:
    Definition: Delay refers to the time it takes for a signal to travel from the sender to the receiver.
    Cause: Delay can be caused by the finite speed of signal propagation in a medium.
    Effect: Excessive delay can impact real-time applications and cause synchronization issues in communication systems.

Jitter:
    Definition: Jitter is the variation in the timing of signal pulses.
    Cause: Jitter can result from irregularities in the transmission medium, clocking errors, or interference.
    Effect: In digital communication, jitter can lead to timing errors and affect the accuracy of data reception.

Interference:
    Definition: Interference occurs when external signals disrupt the normal transmission of the desired signal.
    Cause: Sources of interference include electromagnetic interference (EMI) and radio frequency interference (RFI).
    Effect: Interference can cause signal corruption and decrease the overall reliability of the communication system.

SNR = Avg. Sig. Pow / Avg. Noise Pow
SNR_(dB) = 10 log_10 (SNR)
         = 10 log_10 (P_2/P_1)
         = 20 log_10 (V_2/V_1)
Bit Rate:
    Definition: Bit rate, also known as data rate or digital bandwidth, is the number of bits transmitted per unit of time. It represents the rate at which information is conveyed over a communication channel and is typically measured in bits per second (bps).
    Formula: If NN is the total number of bits transmitted and TT is the total time taken, then the bit rate (RR) can be calculated as R=N/T.
    Example: A communication system that transmits 1000 bits in 1 second has a bit rate of 1000 bps.
    Significance: Bit rate is crucial in digital communication as it determines how much information can be transmitted within a given time frame.

Baud Rate:
    Definition: Baud rate, also referred to as symbol rate or modulation rate, represents the number of signal changes (symbols or states) per second in a communication system. It is associated with modulation techniques and is expressed in baud.
    Formula: Baud rate is not directly related to the number of bits but rather to the number of signal changes. For example, if each signal change represents two bits (binary phase-shift keying or QPSK modulation), then the bit rate would be twice the baud rate.
    Example: In a communication system using binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) with a baud rate of 1000 baud, the bit rate would be 1000 bps if each symbol represents one bit.
    Significance: Baud rate is relevant in analog and digital communication systems where modulation is used to encode digital information onto an analog carrier signal.

**Nyquist Bit Rate = 2 x BandWidth x log_2 L    [; L-> No. of signal levels used to seperate data]

Shannon Capacity : Determines the theoritical highest data rate for a noisy channel.
                   Capacity = Bandwidth x log_2 (1 + SNR)
