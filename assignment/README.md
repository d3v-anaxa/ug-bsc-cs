01. WAP to print the sum and product of digits of an integer.
02. WAP  to reverse a number.
03. WAP to compute the sum of the first n terms of the following series : S = 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + ...
04. WAP to compute the sum of the first n terms of the following series : S = 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + ...
05. WAP to check if palindrome (By taking user-input)
06. Write a function to find whether a given no. is prime or not. Use the same to generate the prime numbers less than 100.
07. WAP to compute the factors of a given number.
08. WAP to print a triangle (By taking user-input)
```cpp
       *
     * * *
   * * * * * 
 * * * * * * *
```
09. WAP to calculate GCD of two numbers (i) with recursion (ii) without recursion.
10. Create a class object with show as virtual function. Inherit two other classes sphere and cube from object. Calculate volume of sphere and cube using necessary parameters and member function.
11. Copy the contents of one text file to another file, after removing all whitespaces.
12. Design a class polar which describes a point in the plain using polar coordinates radius and angle. Use overloaded operator to add two objects of Polar.
